WEBINTERFACE:
	* queue stats: upload speed, queue depth
	* refresh folder after file operation
	* sorting
	* file/folder icons
	* display date
	* add logo
	* add panel with ajax traffic

	done:
	* multiple file upload

FTP:
    * prevent STOR in the fake root folder
    * implement PORT command (active mode)
    * Improve compatibility with some esoteric clients (Aftp etc.)

PERFORMANCE:
	* Simple preemptive kernel to allow async IO

APP:
	* Allow it to run as accessory?
	* display date
	* allow for more then one connection?
	* remove logging (scrolling slows down massively)
	* chdir for RUN command

SCRIPTS:
	* sanities path passed to the tool
	* add help option

BUGS:
	* UI: expanding an empty folder would cause that folder to disappear from the list
	* Does not seem to copy 0 byte files
	* Does not seem to copy empty directories
	* remote file execution is broken
	* garbage caused in GEMDOS filesystem (looks like not all paths are validated which causes directory/path creation which aren't possible to remove  afterwards - it looks like file system corruption)
	* crash when NETUsbee isn't plugged in
