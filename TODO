WEBINTERFACE:
	* add current path field
	* it's possible to select something in folder panel and file panel. This is confusing and only one selection should be possible at a time.
	* closing empty folders (folders with no folders in them) causes the deletion of that folder
	* sorting
	* file/folder icons
	* display date
	* file download/upload and drag&drop
	* add logo
	* add panel with ajax trafic

APP:
	* disable disk drives so it wont collapse
	* Allow it to run as accessory?
	* display date
	* allow for more then one connection?
	* remove logging (scrolling slows down massively)
	* test on ST
	* chdir for RUN command

SCRIPTS:
	* productionise
	* add help option
	* uideploy - add incremental uploads

BUGS:
	* UI: expanding an empty folder would cause that folder to disappear from the list
