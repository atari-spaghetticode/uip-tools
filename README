# Introduction #

uip-tools brings an easy way to upload or download files to your beloved TOS machine with NetUSBee compatible network adapter without a need to MiNT or Sting TCP/IP stacks.
It is a self contained binary, including a TCP/IP based on uIP embedded stack with DHCP support.   

# REST API #

In addition to the HTML based user interface, uiptool allows you to use a simple REST API to do a range of operations:

	upload a file:

		curl -0T filename.tos falcon2/d/filename.tos

		This executes a PUT request.

		note that you need to specify not only destination folder but also a file name!

	download a file:

		curl -0 falcon2/c/filename.tos

	run an executable:

		curl -0 falcon2/c/filename.tos?run="command line"

	delete a file:

		curl -0X DELETE falcon2/c/filename.tos

	create a folder

		curl -0 falcon2/c/foldername?newfolder

	request file info or directory listing in json format

		curl -0 falcon2/c/filename.tos?dir
		curl -0 falcon2/c/foldername?dir
